# Page Load Time

- Page load time measures how long it takes for the contents of a website to show up in the user’s browser. The loading process of a website will consist of multiple milestones, for example starting to show text or displaying a hero image.

- For this website I measured the Page Load time after deploying this website and measured its data from Google’s Page speed insights.
- My First Contentful Paint came out to be 1.6s
- MY Largest Contentful Paint came out to be 1.6s
- My Total Blocking time was 0 sec
- My speed index was 1.6 sec

- The page load time of website depends on the Server Response time, download Sizes and Rendering Times.
